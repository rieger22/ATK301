        <p>A great deal of my musical knowledge has come from first hand experience over the years, starting with piano lessons when I was four years old. From that foundation, I learned upright bass and participated in orchestra for six years, as well as joining various choirs for eleven years.
				<br>I have participated in musicals, spent countless hours recording and shadowing sound engineers, both played, and set up a number of shows, and acted as assistant teacher in music production in high school.

				<p>Below are examples of songs I wrote with a music video I filmed and put together myself. </p>
